Setting Up the Shell Environment To Build and Run Veins and Francisco2 
=======================================================================

 1. From the command line terminal, change directories to the francsico2 repository.
 2. run `git pull` to update the francisco2 repository.
 3. Add the file path of francisco2/src/scripts to the PATH environment variable. 
        `$ export PATH=<path-to-scripts>:$PATH`
 5. open the 'setenv' file in a text editor.
 6. change the OMNET_SRC_DIR; SUMO_HOME; VEINS_SRC_DIR variables to the paths where they are located.
 7. save and close 'setenv'
 8. now update the environment by sourcing the 'setenv' file (this environment must be enabled whenever working with this project)
        `$ source setenv`
 9. Now the environment is also setup for building veins, so change directories again to its source repository and build it.
        `$ make clean`
        `$ ./configure`
        `$ make`
10. change directories back to the francisco2 repository.
11. build francisco2
        `$ make clean`
        `$ ./configure`
        `$ make`
12. start the SUMO server to run simulations
        `$ start-sumo`
13. run the simulator by calling ./francisco from the command-line or by using an IDE including the omnet IDE.
